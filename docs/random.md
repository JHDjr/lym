## Random things

I am yet to figure out where to put these information, that is why they are in 
the random chapter. These will be moved to different chapters in future.


### w command

*w* command shows who all are logged into the computer. If you pass the *-f* flag, it
toggles the information about from where each of the user is logged in.

```
$ w
