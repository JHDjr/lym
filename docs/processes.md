## Process in Linux

A process is a program (think about any Linux application) in running state. It contains various
details, like the memory space the program needs, it has a process id, the files opened by
the process, etc.


### How to view all the running processes?

The following command shows all the processes from your computer.

```
$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.0 215356  4984 ?        Ss   May29   0:28 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --system --deserialize 19
root         2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    May29   0:00 [kthreadd]
root         4  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S<   May29   0:00 [kworker/0:0H]
root         6  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    May29   0:11 [ksoftirqd/0]
root         7  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    May29   8:27 [rcu_sched]
... long output
```

You can see that the output also tells you under which user the process is running, what is actual command being used, the percentage of CPU and memory usage.

*PID* column shows the process id, you can see that the *systemd* process has PID 1, means it is
the first process to start in the system.

### How to find some particular process?

Say I know to know what is the process id of the Firefox browser in my system. I can use the
following command to find that information.

```
$ ps aux | grep firefox
kdas     26752 96.1  9.7 2770724 763436 ?      Sl   16:16   0:35 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox
kdas     26919  0.0  0.0 118520   980 pts/3    S+   16:17   0:00 grep --color=auto firefox
```

Here, we are first running the ps command, and then passing the output of that to the next
command using a | character. In this case, grep is that second command, as you can see, we can find
some text using grep tool. We will learn more about grep in future.

### How to kill/stp a particular process?

We can kill/stop any process using the *kill* command. As we found out that the id of the Firefox process in my computer is 26752, we can use that id to kill it.

```
$ kill 26752
```

If there is no error message, you should be able to see that the Firefox has disappeared. 

### Signals

Signals are a limited way to communicate to a process. You can think about them as notifications
to a process, and depending on the signal handler in the code, the process does something with
that signal. The *kill* command actually sends a signal to the given process id, the default
signal is *TERM*, which says to terminate the process. To directly a process, you can send the *KILL* signal.

```
$ kill -9 26752
```

Here *9* is number representation of the *KILL* signal. To know more about Linux signals,
read from the man page.

```
$ man 7 signal
```

*kill* command also has a *-l* flag, which prints all of the signal names, and numbers on the screen.

```
$Â kill -l
 1) SIGHUP	 2) SIGINT	 3) SIGQUIT	 4) SIGILL	 5) SIGTRAP
 6) SIGABRT	 7) SIGBUS	 8) SIGFPE	 9) SIGKILL	10) SIGUSR1
11) SIGSEGV	12) SIGUSR2	13) SIGPIPE	14) SIGALRM	15) SIGTERM
16) SIGSTKFLT	17) SIGCHLD	18) SIGCONT	19) SIGSTOP	20) SIGTSTP
21) SIGTTIN	22) SIGTTOU	23) SIGURG	24) SIGXCPU	25) SIGXFSZ
26) SIGVTALRM	27) SIGPROF	28) SIGWINCH	29) SIGIO	30) SIGPWR

38) SIGRTMIN+4	39) SIGRTMIN+5	40) SIGRTMIN+6	41) SIGRTMIN+7	42) SIGRTMIN+8
43) SIGRTMIN+9	44) SIGRTMIN+10	45) SIGRTMIN+11	46) SIGRTMIN+12	47) SIGRTMIN+13
48) SIGRTMIN+14	49) SIGRTMIN+15	50) SIGRTMAX-14	51) SIGRTMAX-13	52) SIGRTMAX-12
53) SIGRTMAX-11	54) SIGRTMAX-10	55) SIGRTMAX-9	56) SIGRTMAX-8	57) SIGRTMAX-7
58) SIGRTMAX-6	59) SIGRTMAX-5	60) SIGRTMAX-4	61) SIGRTMAX-3	62) SIGRTMAX-2
63) SIGRTMAX-1	64) SIGRTMAX	
```

### top command

*top* is a very special command while using a Linux system, this is a quick way to know about
all the running processes in the system, and status about CPU and memory usage in general. To get
out of top, press the key *q*.

... long output
```

Btw, feel free to press *1* and see if anything changes in the top command output.

### Load average

If you look at the *top* output carefully, you will find something mentioned as
load average. Actually there are 3 numbers provided, these the load average of the
system, load average of the last one minute, 5 minutes ago, and 15 minutes ago.

```
load average: 0.57, 0.73, 0.75
```

In simple words, load average means the average time any process has to wait to get
access tot the CPU (or other resources), in idle state the load average is 0. This information
is a quick way to learn about the system,  if the system is slow to respond, just looking at the
load-average, and then rest of the top ouput should be a good starting point.


### htop tool

*htop* is a modern version of the top tool. This is many more features, interactiveness
is the biggest among them. *htop* does not come by default in most of the Linux installations,
means you will have to install it using the command package management tool.

The following are the ways to install it in Fedora and in Debian/Ubuntu

```
$ sudo dnf install htop -y
```

```
$ sudo apt-get install htop
```

TODO: add screenshot

To know more about htop, please read the man page.

```
$ man htop
```

### More about Linux processes

You can learn more about Linux processes in the glibc manual. Use the *info* command for the same.

```
$ info libc process
```
